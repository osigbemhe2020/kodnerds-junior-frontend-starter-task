# Features added
the only features i added different from the ui is i changed the images because i did not have them 
and also the pages in the pagination are only five due to limited data

# AI used
VScode co-pilot is so used to using it that i dont know everywhere i used it but i used it alot in the pagination logic

# challenges faced 
the only challenge really came in the pagination logic because it was the first time doing something like the other parts i am used to using already  
## how i solved the problems 
i solved them by working with co-pilot it help me a lot by suggesting the allPages array to help seprate my data into different pages it also helped with the logic
